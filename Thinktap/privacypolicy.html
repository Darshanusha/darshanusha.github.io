      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="lead">Effective date: August 9, 2025</p>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>Think Tap</strong> ("we", "our", or "the App"). We built Think Tap to deliver a simple, private quiz experience. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We only collect the following information from users of the App:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> The display name you provide in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Email address:</strong> Your email if you choose to provide it (used for account identification, backup or support).</li>
        <li><strong>Questions:</strong> Questions you create or save inside the app (these may include the question text, options, correct answer and optional explanations).</li>
        <li><strong>Topics:</strong> Topic names or tags you create or select to organize questions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To store and display your quiz questions and topics inside the app.</li>
        <li>To identify your account and support account-related requests (using your email and name).</li>
        <li>To generate quiz questions using a third-party AI model (see the section below).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Use of AI (ChatGPT) for Question Generation</h2>
      <p>Think Tap uses a third-party AI language model (for example, OpenAI's ChatGPT API) to generate quiz questions when you request new or auto-generated content. When generating content we may send the relevant prompt and context (for example, a topic name or previously entered question text) to that third-party service. That third-party service processes the prompt and returns generated question text to us, which we then store and display in your app.</p>

      <p><strong>Important:</strong> We do not send your full account data or unrelated personal information to the AI provider — only the prompt/context required to generate or improve a question (such as topic name, seed question, or user-provided instructions).</p>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
      <p>Your name, email, questions and topics are stored in the app's storage (local device storage and/or the backend you connect with). We retain your data for as long as your account exists or until you request deletion. If you request account deletion, we will remove your stored data from our active systems within a reasonable time frame and, where possible, from backups per our data-retention practices.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
      <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may share limited data with the following categories of third parties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI provider:</strong> To generate quiz questions (see section 3).</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Hosting, analytics, crash reporting, or email providers used to operate the app. These providers process data on our behalf and are contractually restricted from using it for other purposes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no system is perfectly secure. If you have security-sensitive needs, do not store extremely sensitive personal information in the app.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can access the questions and topics you created from within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request deletion of your data (name, email, questions and topics). Contact us using the details below.</li>
        <li><strong>Email preferences:</strong> If you provided an email, you can opt out of non-essential communications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Think Tap is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 provided personal information to us, please contact us and we will delete that information.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the Effective Date at the top and may provide additional notice inside the app.</p>

      <h2>10. Contact</h2>
